# CSVToGraph

Converts a generated CSV file into a graph.

For task 6 of my Application Programming unit, we compared collection types. This generated custom formatted CSV files.

These scripts format the data and then plot it onto a graph.

There are two graph types that had to be created, one for all tests for a type (e.g show the speed of every test for an ArrayDeque), 
and one for all types for a test (e.g show the speed of ArrayDeque, ArrayList, ... for ADD)
